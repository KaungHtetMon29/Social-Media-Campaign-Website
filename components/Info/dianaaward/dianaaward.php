            <p class="infocontentdetail">The Diana Award’s Anti-Bullying Campaign is a powerful initiative dedicated to
                creating a kinder and safer environment for young people. Inspired by the late Princess Diana's belief
                in the potential of youth, the campaign focuses on empowering students to become Anti-Bullying
                Ambassadors. Through training and support, these young leaders are equipped with the skills to tackle
                bullying within their schools and communities. By promoting a peer-to-peer approach, the Diana Award
                aims to foster a culture of empathy, respect, and inclusivity, ultimately creating a lasting impact on
                the lives of countless young people.</p>
