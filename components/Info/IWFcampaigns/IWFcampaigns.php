            <p class="infocontentdetail">The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) is a UK-based non-profit organization
                dedicated to protecting children from online sexual abuse. They operate the UK hotline for reporting
                online child sexual abuse content and work to remove it from the internet. The IWF also runs awareness
                campaigns like "Thinkuknow" to educate children, parents, and educators about online safety and the
                risks of sharing explicit content. Additionally, their "Child Online Safety" program provides resources
                and support for parents and carers to help them keep their children safe online.</p>
