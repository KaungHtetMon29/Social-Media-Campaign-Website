                <p class="prisk">Staying safe on social media is essential to protect your privacy and well-being.
                    Always be cautious
                    about the information you share onlineâ€”avoid posting sensitive details like your address, phone
                    number, or financial information. Use strong, unique passwords for each account and enable
                    two-factor authentication for added security. Be mindful of who you accept as friends or followers,
                    and regularly review your privacy settings to control who can see your posts. Finally, stay alert to
                    potential scams or phishing attempts, and report any suspicious behavior to the platform. By
                    following these steps, you can enjoy social media while keeping yourself safe. </p>
