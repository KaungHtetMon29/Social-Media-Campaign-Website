            <h2>Teen Brain and Social Media</h2>
            <p>Teen brains are still developing, making them more sensitive to the impacts of social media. While these
                platforms offer opportunities for connection and self-expression, they can also contribute to anxiety,
                depression, and unhealthy comparisons. Constant exposure to curated content can affect self-esteem,
                while the
                addictive nature of social media can disrupt focus and sleep patterns. Itâ€™s crucial to promote safe and
                mindful social media use among teens, encouraging them to balance their online interactions with
                positive
                real-life experiences for healthier mental and emotional development.</p>
